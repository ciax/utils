## This is schema file for sqlite3
## schema file (sc-*.tsv) contains 'table' and 'field' separated by <tab>
## The primary key 'id' is automatically added to each tables.
## If a 'field' content matches with a name of another 'table',
## it is treated as a "foreign key" refering to the 'id' field of the table.
## So the refered table must be shown above those field of line.
